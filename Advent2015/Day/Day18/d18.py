#- Day 18: Like a GIF For Your Yard ---
#After the million lights incident, the fire code has gotten stricter:
#now, at most ten thousand lights are allowed. You arrange them in a 100x100 grid.

#Never one to let you down,
#Santa again mails you instructions on the ideal lighting configuration.
#With so few lights, he says, you'll have to resort to animation.

#Start by setting your lights to the included initial configuration
#your puzzle input).
#A # means "on", and a . means "off".

#Then, animate your grid in steps,
#where each step decides the next configuration based on the current one.
#Each light's next state (either on or off) depends on its current state
#and the current states of the eight lights adjacent to it (including diagonals).
#Lights on the edge of the grid might have fewer than eight neighbors;
#the missing ones always count as "off".

#For example, in a simplified 6x6 grid, the light marked A has the neighbors numbered 1 through 8, and the light marked B, which is on an edge, only has the neighbors marked 1 through 5:

#1B5...
#234...
#......
#..123.
#..8A4.
#..765.
#The state a light should have next is based on its current state (on or off) plus the number of neighbors that are on:

#A light which is on stays on when 2 OR 3 neighbors are on, and turns off otherwise.
#A light which is off turns on if EXACTLY 3 neighbors are on, and stays off otherwise.
#All of the lights update simultaneously; they all consider the same current state before moving to the next.

#Here's a few steps from an example configuration of another 6x6 grid:

#Initial state:
# .#.#.#
# ...##.
# #....#
# ..#...
# #.#..#
# ####..

#After 1 step:
# ..##..
# ..##.#
# ...##.
# ......
# .....
# .##..
#
#After 2 steps:
# ..###.
# ......
# ..###.
# ......
# .#....
# .#....
#
#After 3 steps:
# ...#..
# ......
# ...#..
# ..##..
# ......
# ......
#
#After 4 steps:
# ......
# ......
# ..##..
# ..##..
# ......
# ......

#After 4 steps, this example has four lights on.
